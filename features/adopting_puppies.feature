Feature: Adopting puppies
  As a puppy lover
  I want to adopt puppies
  So they can chew my furniture

  Background:
    Given I am on the puppy adoption site

  Scenario: Validate cart with one puppy
    When I click the first View Details button
    And I click the Adopt Me button
    Then I should see "Brook" as the name for line item 1
    And I should see "$34.95" as the subtotal for line item 1
    And I should see "$34.95" as the cart total

  Scenario: Validate cart with two puppies
    When I click the first View Details button
    And I click the Adopt Me button
    And I click the Adopt Another Puppy button
    And I click the second View Details button
    And I click the Adopt Me button
    Then I should see "Brook" as the name for line item 1
    And I should see "$34.95" as the subtotal for line item 1
    And I should see "Hanna" as the name for line item 2
    And I should see "$22.99" as the subtotal for line item 2
